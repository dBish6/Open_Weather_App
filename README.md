# Open_Weather_App

This weather app utilizes the powerful [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and delivers real-time weather information for cities all around the world! This app also showcases my experimentation with CSS by using PostCSS. I decided to get on the hype train and see what PostCSS was all about and I was not disappointed. You can now customize CSS to your liking with all the amazing plugins that PostCSS offers and yes I think it is better then Sass because you can make PostCSS literally like SCSS and then some. To add, this is not your typical beginner weather app that you see all over the internet, this is a semi-advanced project that shows some of my creativity.
